Every one of us longs to be understood, valued, accepted and loved. Love heals wounds, restores lives, makes you feel worth something, gives you significance and lifts your head to walk with dignity whatever your life journey may have been. As we say many times as a family… Love always wins! </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"col\">\n        <img className='img-fluid' src=\"/images/Waller 1-17.jpg\"></img>\n      </div>\n
