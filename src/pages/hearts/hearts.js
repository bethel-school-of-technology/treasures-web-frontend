                <h2>Our Hearts</h2>
                <p>Our vision is to bring people into complete wholeness in their body, heart &amp; spirit and to help them experience the love Father God has for them. We desire to see people knowing who they are, what they were created to be, being fully restored and living life to the full! And out of that wholeness being able to give that gift of love away to others extravagantly, because love truly can change our world!</p>
                <p>We met as a couple in 2009, both on a journey of stepping into our own wholeness and equipping ourselves to come alongside others. We married in 2011 and have trained in ministry and in various settings with pastoral ministry, Life-coaching, Bethel Sozo, counselling and mentoring. One of our loves is to host wholeness days, evenings, weekends and events offering many experiences and expressions to bring people into greater wholeness. Karen qualified as a professional Life-Coach in 2014 and has personally coached and mentored at least seventy ladies and offers 1-2-1 Christian Coaching/Spiritual Journeying for Ladies and runs various group workshops throughout the UK. She also qualified to Level 3 in counselling in 2019..</p>
                <p>Our passion as a family is to see people become whole through love… to be everything they were created to be and to live in everything they were created for... that’s why we will continues to do all we do…</p>
